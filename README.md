# Drag & Drop Project Manager

## Overview

A TypeScript-based project management application that demonstrates modern web development concepts including drag-and-drop functionality, state management, and component-based architecture. The application allows users to:

- **Add new projects** with title, description, and number of people assigned
- **Organize projects** by dragging them between "Active" and "Finished" lists
- **Real-time updates** with a centralized state management system
- **Form validation** to ensure data integrity

The app features a clean, responsive interface with visual feedback during drag operations, including hover effects and smooth transitions between project states.

- **HTML5 Drag & Drop API** - Native browser drag-and-drop functionality
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with hover effects and responsive design
